## Usage  

### Boot into brom mode  
Once the mtk script is running, boot into brom mode by powering off device,  
press and hold either *vol up + power* or *vol down + power* and connect the phone.  
Once detected by the tool, *release the buttons*.  
  
  
### Using MTKTools via the graphical user interface:  
For the 'basics' you can use the GUI interface. This supports dumping partitions or the full flash for now. Run the following command:  
```bash
python mtk_gui
```

### Run multiple commands
```bash
python mtk script run.example
```
See the file "run.example" on how to structure the script file  
  
### Root the phone (Tested with android 9 - 12)  
  
1. Dump boot and vbmeta  
```bash
python mtk r boot,vbmeta boot.img,vbmeta.img
```

2. Reboot the phone
```bash
python mtk reset
```

3. Download latest [Magisk](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases)  

4. Install on target phone
- you need to enable usb-debugging via Settings/About phone/Version, Tap 7x on build number
- Go to Settings/Additional settings/Developer options, enable "OEM unlock" and "USB Debugging"
- Install magisk apk
```bash
adb install Magisk.apk
```
- accept auth rsa request on mobile screen of course to allow adb connection

5. Upload boot to /sdcard/Download
```bash
adb push boot.img /sdcard/Download
```

6. Start magisk, tap on Install, select boot.img from /sdcard/Download, then:  
- Copy to pc and rename to boot.patched  
```bash
adb pull /sdcard/Download/[DISPLAYED MAGISK PATCHED BOOT FILENAME HERE]
mv [DISPLAYED MAGISK PATCHED BOOT FILENAME HERE] boot.patched
```

7. If these two commands below doesnt work 
- Putting into FASTBOOT MODE 
```bash
adb reboot bootloader ## OR manually via buttons.  
```
- Unlocking bootloader (via fastboot)  
```bash
fastboot flashing unlock ## your's might be different
```
- Unlocking bootloader (if fastboot is unavailable/command is not known/hard bricked?)  
```bash
python mtk e metadata,userdata,md_udc
python mtk da seccfg unlock
```

8. Flash Magisk patched `boot.patched`  
```bash
python mtk w boot,vbmeta boot.patched,vbmeta.img.empty
```
- If ^ command didn't work, rename your device's `vbmeta.img` to `vbmeta.img.empty` then execute again..  
```bash
python mtk w boot,vbmeta boot.patched,vbmeta.img.empty
```

9. Reboot the phone  
```bash
python mtk reset
```

10. Disconnect usb cable and enjoy your rooted phone :) 
   

## Troubleshooting  
- Struggle to get phone detected by pc in mtkclient?  

:: Phone must be switched off.  
:: Could be bad a usb cable or improper connection to USB port of pc/phone.  
:: Disconnect and connect again..  
 
- If command sent by 2nd terminal fails and show some error message, means it probably worked.

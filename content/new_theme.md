# Update
Site now uses an elegant theme: [Kita](https://github.com/st1020/kita)  
Generated by [zola](https://www.getzola.org/), previously [hugo](https://gohugo.io/)  

# How to use this theme?
Basic guide is available at Kita's [github](https://github.com/st1020/kita)  

This is how I did..  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/st1020/kita  your_site
cd your_site
```

## Clean up
- Edit config.toml: find n replace with your name
- Remove *example* materials
- Remove `placeholders*.md` from `content/`

## Adding content
- Create new file.md in `content/`
- Writing Markdown [guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
